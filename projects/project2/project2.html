      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project explores the application of phase-field modeling techniques to simulate the evolution of ferroelectric domains.
        Ferroelectric materials are widely used in memory devices, sensors, and actuators due to their unique polarization properties.
      </p>

      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop a phase-field simulation framework for modeling ferroelectric domain dynamics.</li>
        <li>Analyze domain evolution under varying external conditions such as electric fields and mechanical stress.</li>
        <li>Validate simulation results with experimental data.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <p>
        The simulation framework employs the phase-field method, solving coupled partial differential equations that describe the 
        domain structure and its evolution. Key tools and techniques include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Finite-difference schemes for spatial discretization.</li>
        <li>Time-stepping methods for temporal integration.</li>
        <li>Visualization of domain patterns using VTK and ParaView.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        Preliminary simulations demonstrate the formation of complex domain structures and their response to external stimuli. 
        Detailed results will be provided in subsequent updates.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Future Work</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Incorporate additional physical effects, such as thermal fluctuations and defect dynamics.</li>
        <li>Optimize computational performance for larger-scale simulations.</li>
        <li>Collaborate with experimentalists to validate and refine the model.</li>
      </ul>
