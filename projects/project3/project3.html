      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project explores digital image processing using Python, starting from fundamental concepts and progressing to real-world applications. Our aim was to understand how images can be processed, enhanced, and analyzed using a range of powerful techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
        We began with <strong>Image Derivatives and Laplacians</strong>, which are essential tools for detecting edges and features within images. By understanding how pixel values change at the edges, we were able to identify objects and shapes more accurately, laying a strong foundation for further image analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, we explored <strong>Noise in Digital Images</strong>, which often appears as grainy spots or random dots that reduce image quality. Different types of noise, such as Gaussian, salt-and-pepper, and Poisson noise, were analyzed to understand their impact on images and the challenges they pose for image processing.
    </p>
    <p>
        To effectively reduce noise, we implemented <strong>Total Variation Denoising</strong>, a technique that preserves important details like edges while minimizing unwanted noise. <strong>Gradient Descent</strong> was used to optimize this process, allowing us to find the best possible version of the image with enhanced clarity and detail.
    </p>
    <p>
        Building on these fundamentals, we applied our knowledge to a practical and advanced application: <strong>X-Ray Imaging</strong>. We explored how X-ray images are created using the <strong>Beer-Lambert Law</strong> for X-ray attenuation and how they are reconstructed using <strong>Filtered Back Projection</strong>. This application demonstrated how image processing techniques are crucial in medical diagnostics and industrial imaging.
