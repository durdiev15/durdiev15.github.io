            <p>
                <b>Continuous Signals:</b> A continuous image can be represented as \(u(x,y)\), where $x$ and $y$ are spatial coordinates, and denotes the intensity or value at that point.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Digital Images:</b> In practice, images are sampled into discrete points. This results in a matrix representation $\{u_{m,n}\}$, where $m$ and $n$ denote row and column indices.

                Partial Derivatives in Images
            </h2>
            <p>
                The derivatives of an image correspond to variations in intensity along different directions. For a sampled image $\{u_{m,n}\}$, the partial derivatives are approximated as:
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Derivative in the x-direction:</b>
                $$
                \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \approx u_{m+1, n} - u_{m,n}
                $$
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Derivative in the y-direction:</b>
                $$
                \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \approx u_{m, n+1} - u_{m,n}
                $$
            </p>
            <p>
                These expressions compute the change in intensity between neighboring pixels, which highlights edges and transitions in the image.
            </p>
            <p>The <b>Laplacian</b>, a second-order derivative, combines variations in both directions and is given by:</p>
            $$
            \nabla^2 u = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}
            $$
            <p>In a discrete setting, the Laplacian is approximated as:</p>
            $$
            \nabla^2 u = u_{m+1, n} + u_{m-1, n} + u_{m, n+1} + u_{m, n-1} - 4u_{m,n}
            $$
            <p>The Laplacian is widely used for tasks such as edge detection and image sharpening, as it emphasizes regions with rapid intensity changes. </p>

                Python Code
            </h2>
            <p>In image processing, derivatives help analyze variations in pixel intensity, aiding in detecting edges, textures, and patterns. Below is a Python implementation for calculating partial derivatives and the Laplacian of a grayscale image. First, import the libraries </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from skimage import data
import numpy as np
from scipy.ndimage import laplace
</code></pre>
<p>Here we use the grayscale camera man image from <code>skimage.data</code>. The pixel intensities range from 0 to 255. Hence, we normalize it to scale the pixel values to a standard range (e.g., 0–1), making the data uniform and easier to process. It is very important becuase algorithms involving derivatives or filtering can become unstable with large intensity ranges, and normalized values ensure that calculations (e.g., gradients, convolution) are performed on smaller, consistent numbers, reducing the risk of overflow or rounding errors.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Load and normalize the grayscale image
grayscale = data.camera()
xray_image = (grayscale - np.min(grayscale)) / (np.max(grayscale) - np.min(grayscale))
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we calculate the first-order partial derivatives using a finite difference scheme, as shown above.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def finite_difference_derivative(image):
    """
    Compute first-order partial derivatives of an image.
    """
    # Derivative w.r.t. x (horizontal changes)
    du_dx = np.zeros_like(image)
    du_dx[:, :-1] = image[:, 1:] - image[:, :-1]

    # Derivative w.r.t. y (vertical changes)
    du_dy = np.zeros_like(image)
    du_dy[:-1, :] = image[1:, :] - image[:-1, :]

    return du_dx, du_dy

# Compute partial derivatives
du_dx, du_dy = finite_difference_derivative(xray_image)
</code></pre>
<p>To calculate the Laplacian we can use <code>scipy.ndimage.laplace</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Compute the Laplacian using scipy.ndimage
laplacian_xray = laplace(xray_image)
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, visualize the derivatives and the Laplacian of the image:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Visualization
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(10, 10))

# Original image
ax[0, 0].imshow(xray_image, cmap='gray')
ax[0, 0].set_title('Original Image')

# ∂u/∂x (Horizontal gradient)
ax[0, 1].imshow(du_dx, cmap='gray')
ax[0, 1].set_title(r'$\partial u/\partial x$')

# ∂u/∂y (Vertical gradient)
ax[1, 0].imshow(du_dy, cmap='gray')
ax[1, 0].set_title(r'$\partial u/\partial y$')

# Laplacian (Second-order derivative)
ax[1, 1].imshow(laplacian_xray, cmap='gray')
ax[1, 1].set_title(r'$\nabla^2 u$')

# Disable axes for a cleaner view
for row in ax: 
    for a in row: 
        a.axis('off')

# Show the visualization
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
</code></pre>

            <h1>Noise in Digital Image Processing: Types and Effects</h1>
            <p>Noise in digital images comes from two main sources: <strong>image acquisition</strong> and <strong>image transmission</strong>.

                <p><strong>Image Acquisition</strong>: Noise can occur due to environmental conditions or issues with the camera's sensor. For example, a CCD camera might produce noisy images if the light levels are too low or the sensor gets too hot.</p>
                <p><strong>Image Transmission</strong>: Noise can happen during transmission because of interference in the communication channel. For instance, a wireless network transmission might introduce noise due to lightning or other atmospheric disturbances.</p>
                <p>In short, noise is caused by either the camera setup or the way the image is sent from one place to another. In this post, we assume that noise is independent of the spatial coordinates of the image. Additionally, the noise is considered uncorrelated with the image itself, meaning there is no relationship between the pixel values and the noise affecting them.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="noises">
            <h2>Noise Probability Density Functions</h2>
                        <p>In image processing, restoration filters are often tested by intentionally adding noise to the original data. This noise is treated as a random variable and is described using a <strong>probability density function (PDF)</strong>. The PDF represents the likelihood of different noise values and helps model how noise affects an image.</p>
            <p>To demonstrate the noise models, let's use a simple test pattern to highlight their effects clearly. This pattern consists of uniform regions with three distinct gray levels ranging from black to near white. Its simplicity makes it ideal for visually analyzing how different types of noise affect an image.</p>
            <img src="test_pattern.png" 
                alt="Test pattern image with three uniform gray levels ranging from black to near white, designed to illustrate the effects of different noise types in image processing."

            <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: #555;">Figure 1: Test pattern image with three uniform gray levels ranging from black to near white.</p>

            <p>We will apply various noise types to this pattern and display the results along with their <b>histograms</b> to better understand the noise characteristics. Here is the python code to create the test pattern:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create the test pattern
def create_test_pattern():
    # Initialize an array with all zeros (black)
    pattern = np.zeros((300, 300), dtype=np.float32)

    # Add a medium gray rectangle
    pattern[50:250, 50:250] = 0.5  # Gray level 0.5

    # Add a light gray circle
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(np.arange(300), np.arange(300))
    circle_mask = (X - 150)**2 + (Y - 150)**2 <= 50**2
    pattern[circle_mask] = 0.75  # Gray level 0.75

    return pattern

# Create a sample grayscale image (normalized to [0, 1])
image = create_test_pattern()
plt.imshow(image, cmap="gray", vmin=0, vmax=1)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

        <section id="GaussianNoise">
            <h3>Gaussian Noise</h3>
            <p>Gaussian noise, also known as normal noise, is commonly encountered in digital imaging due to its mathematical convenience in spatial and frequency domains. This noise is typically caused by electronic circuit noise or sensor imperfections. Its PDF, \(p(x)\) follows a bell-shaped curve, and noise values (\(x\)) cluster around a mean (\(\mu\)), with most values lying within a specific range defined by the standard deviation (\(\sigma\)):
                $$p(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} e^{-(x-\mu)^2/(2\sigma^2)}$$
                For example, poor lighting or high sensor temperature can introduce Gaussian noise during image acquisition. The following figure demonstrates the Gaussian noise model:</p>

                  </figure>
                <p>Below is the python code:</p>

<section id="RayleighNoise">
<h3>Rayleigh Noise</h3>
<p>Rayleigh noise is asymmetric and skewed to the right. It is often used to model noise in range imaging applications. Its PDF starts at a minimum value and grows towards a peak before tapering off. This type of noise is useful for approximating certain imaging environments with skewed intensity distributions. To implement the Rayleigh PDF as described in the document, we use the formula:
\[
p(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
\frac{2}{b} (x - a) e^{-\frac{(x - a)^2}{b}}, & x \geq a \\
0, & x < a
\end{cases}
\]
where \(a\) is the minimum value of \(x\) for which the PDF is non-zero, and \(b\)  is a parameter that controls the spread of the distribution.
The following figure demonstrates the Gaussian noise model:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># Add Rayleigh noise
def add_rayleigh_noise(image, scale=0.1):
    noise = np.random.rayleigh(scale, image.shape)
    noisy_image = image + noise
    return np.clip(noisy_image, 0, 1)
</code></pre>
<p>To implement it in Python, we use <code>np.random.rayleigh</code>, where the <code>scale</code> parameter determines the spread or width of the distribution. It directly influences the variance and peak of the PDF.</p>

</section>

<section id="GammaNoise">
<h3>Gamma (Erlang) Noise</h3>
<p>Gamma noise, a generalization of Rayleigh noise, is often used in laser imaging systems. It is characterized by a shape parameter and a scale parameter.
When the shape parameter is an integer, the distribution is called Erlang noise. Gamma noise appears in laser imaging setups where intensity fluctuations follow specific distributions. The PDF formula is given as
\[
p(x) =
\begin{cases} 
\frac{a^b x^{b-1} e^{-a x}}{(b-1)!}, & \text{for } x \geq 0, \\
0, & \text{for } x < 0.
\end{cases}
\]
where \(x\) is the random variable (intensity value). \(a>0\) is the rate parameter (scale), and \(b\) is the shape parameter (integer). \((b-1)!\) is the factorial of \((b-1)\). The following figure demonstrates the Gamma noise model:</p>
    <figure>
    <img src="gamma_pdf.png" alt="Erlang Probability Density Function" style="width: 32%; display: inline-block; margin-right: 1%;">

        Figure: Subplots showing (1) Erlang noise PDF, (2) the test pattern with Erlang noise, and (3) the histogram of the noisy test pattern.

<h3>Exponential Noise</h3>
<p>Exponential noise is a simpler form of Gamma noise where the shape parameter equals one. Its PDF decreases exponentially from a peak value. This type of noise occurs in scenarios with a rapid drop-off in intensity, such as certain imaging applications involving lasers. 
\[
p(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
a e^{-a x}, & x \geq 0 \\
0, & x < 0 
\end{cases}
\]
where \(a\) is  the rate parameter, which controls how quickly the probability decreases as \(x\) increases. The following figure demonstrates the exponential noise model:

<section id="UniformNoise">
<h3>Uniform Noise</h3>
<p>Uniform noise assumes that all values within a specified range \([a, b]\) are equally likely. The PDF is constant within this range and zero outside of it. This type of noise is often used in simulations because of its simplicity and even distribution. Although not commonly found in real-world scenarios, uniform noise is useful for testing restoration algorithms.\[
p(x) =
\begin{cases} 
\frac{1}{b - a} & \text{if } a \leq x \leq b, \\
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\]

<section id="ImpulseNoise">
<h3>Impulse (Salt and Pepper) Noise</h3>
<p>Impulse noise, also known as salt-and-pepper noise, appears as random black and white pixels scattered throughout the image. It occurs due to sudden disturbances, such as faulty hardware, transmission errors, or environmental factors during image acquisition.
\[
p(z) =
\begin{cases} 
P_a & \text{for } z = a, \\
P_b & \text{for } z = b, \\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]
where \(a\) is the intensity value of the dark impulse (e.g., black noise), \(b\) is the intensity value of the light impulse (e.g., white noise). \(P_a\) and \(P_b\) are the probabilities of the dark and light impulses, respectively. The following figure demonstrates the exponential noise model:</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Noise is an inevitable challenge in digital image processing, arising from various sources during acquisition and transmission. Understanding the types of noise, such as Gaussian, Rayleigh, and salt-and-pepper noise, helps in designing effective restoration filters and improving image quality. By modeling noise using PDFs, we can simulate real-world conditions, analyze their impact, and develop solutions tailored to specific noise characteristics. </p>
